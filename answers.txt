Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging joins together two seperate branches by creating a new 
"merge commit" that preserves the full history of both. Rebasing, however,
rewrites the project's history by moving and re-applying commits to create a
clean, linear sequence.
